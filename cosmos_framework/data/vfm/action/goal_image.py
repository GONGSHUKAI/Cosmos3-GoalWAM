"""Goal-image conditioning helpers shared by training and serving.

The goal image (last frame of a training episode, or the terminal frame of the
rule-based expert at eval time) conditions the action policy through the
REASONER (AR) branch: it is encoded by the frozen Qwen3-VL vision tower and its
embeddings are scattered at ``<|image_pad|>`` placeholder positions inside the
AR text sequence, exactly like Qwen3-VL multimodal understanding. The trained
generation tower reads it via the existing joint attention.

This module owns the two artifacts every goal-conditioned sample needs:

* the placeholder string prepended to the caption (reserves the token slots),
* the ViT-ready ``pixel_values``/``image_grid_thw`` tensors (the slot content).

Sizing is pinned per layout (no smart-resize) so training and eval preprocess
bit-identically. The image-processor settings mirror the Qwen3-VL-8B
``preprocessor_config.json`` (``patch_size=16``, ``temporal_patch_size=2``,
``merge_size=2``, ``image_mean=image_std=0.5``); we construct the processor
from explicit kwargs so dataloader workers never touch the HF cache.
